            <p>
              We are getting married at Syverstad g√•rd in Asker, 25 minutes by
              car from the centre of Oslo. Syverstad is a farm in operation,
              with sheep, bees, chickens and pigs. Next to this they have
              renovated a 300 year old barn to a venue for festivities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are going for good weather on our big day, and we plan to have
              the ceremony in the garden. The dinner will be served in the barn,
              so there will be no need to travel between venues. The address of
              the venue is Syverstadveien 21, and you can read more about it{" "}

              Holmen Fjordhotell is a 10 minute walk from the venue (through a
              small forest), right by the sea. We have reserved rooms for the
              guests who want to book a room close by. If you give our names and
              our address (Pilotveien 10, 0770 Oslo) upon booking you will get a
              10 % discount on the room. The prices listed below are already
              discounted.
